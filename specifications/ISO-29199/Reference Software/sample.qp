
# This is a sample QP map file that defines a QP map for a
# color image with a tile 4x4 macroblocks. The format is simple enough
# and this example illustrates all the aspects of the format.
#
# The file is free-formatted. Comments start with a '#' and continue
# to the end of the text line. white space separates tokens and can be
# used freely. Keywords are case sensitive, and numbers are unsigned
# decimal.

# The complete list of keywords is:
#
#   DC, HP, LP, channel, independent, separate, tile, uniform
#

# A tile section is needed for each tile in the image to compress. The
# values in the () are the column and row of the tile that you are
# configuring. In this case, the (0,0) means this is the upper left tile.
tile (0,0) {

  # Specify a component mode. The value values are:
  #
  #   uniform   - all the components are the same. In this case, you
  #               only need to specify channel 0, and all the other
  #               channels will copy their values from that channel.
  #
  #   separate  - The first channel uses one QP set, and all the other
  #               channels use another QP set. You will only need to
  #               specify channel-0 and channel-1.
  #   independent
  #             - All the channels have their own channel set. You
  #               need to specify the channel set for all the channels
  #               in the image.
  separate

  # Next, give all the QP parameters for the channels that you
  # need. For each channel, specify the DC, LP and HP qp values. The
  # QP values range from 0-255 inclusive, with 0 being lossless and
  # 255 being most lossy.
  #
  # There is always exactly 1 DC QP value for each channel.
  #
  # There is at least 1 and at most 16 LP(HP) QP values, and the
  # number of LP(HP) values must be the same for each channel. For
  # example, if channel 0 has 2 LP values, channel 1 must also have 2
  # LP values. The same is true for HP values. (There can be different
  # numbers of LP and HP QP values. For example, it is OK to have 2 LP
  # QP values and 1 HP QP value.
  channel 0 {
	DC { 1 }
	LP { 1, 100 }
	HP { 1, 150 }
  }
  # Note that the comma listing the QP values is optional.
  channel 1 {
	DC { 5 }
	LP { 5 240 }
	HP { 5 250 }
  }

  # Finally, map each macroblock to an LP(HP) QP value by specifying
  # the index here. For this step you need the dimensions of the tile
  # in macroblocks, and you need to specify a map value for each
  # macroblock. In this example, there are 16 macroblocks in this tile
  # (it doesn't matter if they are arranged 4x4 or 8x2 or whatever)
  # and they are assigned in raster order.
  #
  # The number in the map is an index into the LP or HP list above,
  # and can range from 0 to the number of items in the list above. For
  # example, in this example the channels have 2 LP QP values so the
  # index value can be 0 or 1. If there were 5 LP QP items then the
  # values would range from 0-4.
  #
  # You need to map the LP and HP values independently.
  #
  # Each map selects the LP(HP) QP values for all the channels. Recall
  # the constraint above that the LP(HP) QP list have the same length
  # for all the channels.
  #
  # If an LP or HP map is left out, then it is assumed to contain all
  # zeros. This is useful if for example there is only 1 QP value for
  # LP/HP subband, or if the subband is to be dropped by the
  # compressor.
  #
  # Note that the map is surrounded by [] instead of {} to more
  # clearly distinguish this map from the QP list inside the channels.
  LP [ 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0
       1 1 1 1
       1 1 1 1 ]

  HP [ 0 0 0 0
       0 0 0 0
       1 1 1 1
       1 1 1 1 ]
